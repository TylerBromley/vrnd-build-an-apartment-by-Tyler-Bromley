# Build an Apartment Starter Project

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

## Versions
- Unity 2017.1.0p4
- GVR Unity SDK v1.70.0

## Notes
- This took me longer than I thought it would... went down a few wrong paths. But I'd say it took me between 5-10 hours.
- I liked seeing the baked lighting make the scene go from looking like a bunch of cartoony polygons turn into a realistic-looking scene.
- The thing that I found most challenging was the globe animation. It still seems a bit buggy, but it feels above my current level to understand why.
